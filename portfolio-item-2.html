                >U CAN CHEW empowers bakeries to create and manage their menus, listing the delicious food items they have available.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Food Waste Reduction:</strong><br>
                One of the core missions of this app is to combat food waste. Bakeries can use the platform to notify users when food items are nearing their expiry, providing an opportunity for users to rescue and enjoy these items.

            </p>
            <p><strong>Geolocation-Based Services:</strong><br>
                The app harnesses the power of geolocation through "postcodes.io," allowing users to find bakeries in their vicinity based on postcode information. This feature simplifies the process of discovering local food options.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Interactive Maps with Leaflet JS:</strong><br>
                To enhance the user experience, >U CAN CHEW utilizes Leaflet JS to display bakery locations on maps. This visual element makes it easy for users to identify nearby bakeries and points of interest.
            </p>
            <p><strong>Order Creation and Management:</strong><br>
                Users can seamlessly create, customize, and manage their orders, promoting convenience and flexibility. The app supports full CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) functionality for both customers and bakeries, ensuring a seamless order process.            
            </p>
